# Release notes

## 1.8.0
- added support for scanning barcodes with _BlinkID_
- added support for performing raw OCR with _BlinkID_
- improved USDL barcode parsing
	- better handling of FullName, FullAddress, Height and Weight of cardholder
- fixed crash in USDL parser
- fixed race condition causing memory leak or rare crashes
- fixed `NullPointerException` in `BaseCameraView.dispatchTouchEvent`
- fixed bug that caused returning scan result from old video frame
- fixed `NullPointerException` in camera2 management
- fixed rare race condition in gesture recognizer
- fixed segmentation fault on recognizer reconfiguration operation
- fixed freeze when camera was being quickly turned on and off
- ensured `RecognizerView` lifecycle methods are called on UI thread
- ensure `onCameraPreviewStarted` is not called if camera is immediately closed after start before the call should have taken place
- ensure `onScanningDone` is not called after `RecognizerView` has been paused, even if it had result ready just before pausing
- added support for using _BlinkID_ as camera capture API. To do that, implement following:
	- when using `RecognizerView` do not call `setRecognitionSettings` or call it with `null` or empty array
	- implement `ImageListener` interface and set the listener with `setImageListener`
	- as a reminder - you can process video frames obtained that way using DirectAPI method `recognizeImageWithSettings`
- added `BlinkIDDemoCustomSegmentScan ` demo app that demonstrates advanced integration of SegmentScan feature within custom scan activity. It also demonstrates how to perform generic OCR of full camera frame, how to draw OCR results on screen and how to obtain OcrResult object for further processing.
- all demo apps now use Maven integration method because it is much easier than importing AAR manually

## 1.7.1
- fixed NullPointerException when RecognizerSettings array element was `null`
- fixed black rectangle bug on some devices

## 1.7.0
- utilize Camera2 API on devices that support it to achieve much better frame grabbing performance
- new algorithm for determining which video frame is of good enough quality to be processed - it uses much less memory than last one and works in separate thread so it does not impact image recognition thread
	- this results in much better and faster scanning performance
- support for [defining camera metering areas](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/BaseCameraView.html#setMeteringAreas(com.microblink.geometry.Rectangle[])) that will camera use to perform focus, exposure and white balance measurement.
- support for obtaining raw MRZ text even if our internal parser fails to parse it
	- in order to do that, you must [enable returning of unparsed MRTD results](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setAllowUnparsedResults(boolean))
	- when obtaining [MRTD recognition result](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html), you should check if [MRZ was parsed](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html#isMRZParsed())
		- if MRZ was parsed, you can obtain parsed data as ususal
		- if MRZ was not parsed, you can obtain [raw OCR result](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognitionResult.html#getOcrResult()) and parse it yourself
- added support for Visa MRZ format in internal MRZ parser
- support for obtaining image of [MRZ zone](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setShowMRZ(boolean)) and [full document image](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/recognizers/ocr/mrtd/MRTDRecognizerSettings.html#setShowFullDocument(boolean)) via [ImageListener](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/image/ImageListener.html)
- bitmaps can now be processed while [RecognizerView](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html) is active using method [recognizeBitmap](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html#recognizeBitmap(android.graphics.Bitmap, com.microblink.hardware.orientation.Orientation, com.microblink.view.recognition.ScanResultListener))
- removed method `resumeScanningWithoutStateReset` - method [resumeScanning](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html#resumeScanning(boolean)) of [RecognizerView](https://blinkid.github.io/blinkid-android/com/microblink/view/recognition/RecognizerView.html) now receives `boolean` indicating whether internal state should be reset
- by default, null quiet zone is now set to `true` in US Driver's License recognizer

## 1.6.0
- removed support for ARMv5 and ARMv6 processors (armeabi) because of their very poor scanning performance
- optimized MRZ text extraction algorithm - 0-O confusion now does not cause extremely long processing that resulted in freezing the device
- updated documentation with use cases for which BlinkID is applicable
- fixed crash in DirectAPI when recognizer was terminated in the middle of recognition process

## 1.5.0
- support for defining camera aspect mode via intent
- removed autoscale setting from USDL recognizer - autoscale is now always used
- added MRZ detector to MRTD recognizer - Machine Readable Zone location can now be detected almost everywhere on the image

## 1.4.0
- added support for defining region for scanning MRZ
- added support for scanning UK Driver's Licence, check [README](Readme.md) for details
- improved parsing of MRZ (Machine Readable Zones)
- support for defining camera zoom level
- fixed NPE when null SuccessCallback was given

## 1.3.1

## 1.3.0
- Added support for non-standard issuing authorities

## 1.2.0
